> does this folder fulfill these requirements # Data Lineage POC — Step‑by‑Step Guide

  A concise, executable plan to build a small Python tool that traces how data moves and changes across simple ETL pipelines. This guide mirrors the problem 
  statement, tasks/deliverables, and timeline you provided.

  ---

  ## 0) Goal (What You Will Ship)

  * A working **mock ETL** (≥2 pipelines) that produces processed outputs.
  * A **metadata logger** that records lineage to **JSON and CSV**.
  * **Sample lineage logs** from runs of both pipelines.
  * A **visual lineage diagram** (Mermaid file or a tiny Streamlit UI).
  * A **glossary** of fields and transformation steps.
  * A repo with **README** and a **User Guide** explaining setup and usage.

  ---

  ## 1) Prerequisites

  * Python **3.10+** (3.11 recommended)
  * `pip` / `venv`
  * OS‑agnostic shell (bash/zsh/PowerShell)

  > Optional (only if you choose the UI path): `streamlit`, `networkx`, `pyvis`.

  Install (example):

  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install pandas pyyaml click
  # Optional UI
  pip install streamlit networkx pyvis
  ```

  ---

  ## 2) Repository Scaffold (Create Once)

  ```
  lineage-poc/
    data/
      raw/            # mock input CSVs
      processed/      # ETL outputs
    lineage/
      events/         # JSON event files per run + aggregated CSV
    pipelines/
      etl_orders.py
      etl_customers_daily.py
    tools/
      make_mermaid.py # CSV -> Mermaid generator (if using Mermaid)
    app/
      streamlit_app.py # optional UI
    docs/
      glossary.yaml
      usage.md
    README.md
    run_pipeline.py
    lineage_logger.py
  ```

  ---

  ## 3) Step‑by‑Step Build

  ### Step 1 — Research & Plan (short)

  * Define **two** small pipelines you’ll build (e.g., `etl_orders` and `etl_customers_daily`).
  * Decide visualization path: **Mermaid** (static) **or** **Streamlit** (interactive).

  ### Step 2 — Create Mock Datasets

  Create 2–3 small CSVs in `data/raw/` (e.g., `customers.csv`, `orders.csv`). Keep 20–200 rows so runs are fast.

  ### Step 3 — Implement Pipeline #1 (`pipelines/etl_orders.py`)

  * Read `orders.csv` (+ optional join to `customers.csv`).
  * Transform a few columns (e.g., `net_amount = amount - discount`).
  * Write output to `data/processed/orders_clean.csv`.

  ### Step 4 — Implement the Metadata Logger (`lineage_logger.py`)

  Create minimal helpers that you can call from any pipeline:

  * `start_run(job_namespace: str, job_name: str) -> run_id`
  * `log_io(run_id, inputs=[...], outputs=[...], schema_facets, row_counts)`
  * `log_column_lineage(run_id, mappings=[{downstream, upstream[], transformation}])`
  * `end_run(run_id, status="COMPLETED|FAILED", duration_ms)`

  Write each run as a JSON file to `lineage/events/` and append a row to `lineage/events.csv` with: 
  `event_time,run_id,job_namespace,job_name,input_names,output_names,transform,columns_map,rowcount_in,rowcount_out,status`.

  ### Step 5 — Wire Logger Into Pipeline #1

  * At script start: call `start_run()`.
  * After reading inputs: call `log_io()` with input dataset names and inferred schema (list of `{name,type}`).
  * After writing outputs: call `log_io()` again with outputs + output schema, row counts.
  * Record column‑level mappings for at least two derived fields via `log_column_lineage()`.
  * At end (success/fail): `end_run()`.

  ### Step 6 — Implement Pipeline #2 (`pipelines/etl_customers_daily.py`)

  * Example: filter active customers, dedupe, hash emails, compute `is_high_value` flag.
  * Repeat Step 5 instrumentation so this pipeline also emits JSON and CSV lineage.

  ### Step 7 — Add Visualization (choose one)

  **Option A: Mermaid**

  * Implement `tools/make_mermaid.py` that reads `lineage/events.csv` and prints a `graph TD` Mermaid diagram connecting **datasets** and **jobs**.
  * Save as `lineage/diagram.mmd` and preview in VS Code or any Mermaid viewer.

  **Option B: Streamlit** (Optional)

  * Implement `app/streamlit_app.py` that loads `events.csv`, builds a small graph (e.g., with `networkx`/`pyvis`), and shows clickable nodes listing input/output
   schemas and column lineage facets.

  ### Step 8 — Glossary & Tags

  * Draft `docs/glossary.yaml` with dataset owners, field definitions/types, PII flags, and notes for key transforms.

  ### Step 9 — Validate on a Fresh Run

  * Run both pipelines end‑to‑end to generate **sample lineage logs from ≥2 pipelines**.
  * Confirm JSON files exist in `lineage/events/` and that `lineage/events.csv` has rows for both jobs.
  * Generate/refresh the diagram (Mermaid) **or** launch Streamlit UI.

  ### Step 10 — Documentation & Repo Polish

  * **README.md**: purpose, quickstart, commands, folder map, screenshots.
  * **docs/usage.md**: how to add a new pipeline (copy/paste template with the 4 logger calls).
  * Include your **glossary** and the **visual diagram** (or screenshot of UI).

  ---

  ## 4) Commands (Copy/Paste)

  Run pipelines:

  ```bash
  python run_pipeline.py --name etl_orders
  python run_pipeline.py --name etl_customers_daily
  ```

  Generate Mermaid (if chosen):

  ```bash
  python tools/make_mermaid.py lineage/events.csv > lineage/diagram.mmd
  ```

  Launch Streamlit UI (if chosen):

  ```bash
  streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
  ```

  ---

  ## 5) Success Criteria (Directly Aligned to Your Document)

  Your project is **successful** when all of the following are true:

  1. **Program executing an ETL pipeline with mock dataset** exists and runs without errors (≥2 pipelines built and executed).
  2. A **metadata logger** writes lineage in **JSON and CSV** (per‑run JSON files + aggregated CSV).
  3. You provide **sample lineage logs from at least two pipelines** (both pipelines produce events on fresh runs).
  4. A **visual lineage diagram** is produced (**Mermaid.js** file or a static/interactive graph via Streamlit).
  5. A **glossary** documents fields and transformation steps (owners, types, PII flags where applicable).
  6. The **project repository** contains a clear **README** and a **User Guide** explaining setup and tool usage.

  > Meeting all six items above fulfills the Deliverables from the problem statement you provided and demonstrates the Industry Skills Developed (metadata 
  modeling, end‑to‑end lineage, observability/documentation, lightweight ETL, JSON/YAML tooling integration).

  ---

  ## 6) Submission Checklist (Quick)

  * [ ] `pipelines/etl_orders.py` and `etl_customers_daily.py` run and generate outputs in `data/processed/`.
  * [ ] `lineage/events/*.json` created and `lineage/events.csv` appended.
  * [ ] Mermaid diagram in `lineage/diagram.mmd` **or** Streamlit app screenshot included.
  * [ ] `docs/glossary.yaml` completed.
  * [ ] `README.md` + `docs/usage.md` finalized with instructions and screenshots.

  ---

  ## 7) Notes & Tips

  * Keep CSVs tiny so iterations are fast.
  * Favor explicit column‑lineage mappings for any derived field.
  * Make the logger **pipeline‑agnostic** so new jobs only call the 4 functions (start, io, column‑map, end).
  * If time‑pressed, choose **Mermaid** for guaranteed, lightweight visualization.

⏺ Perfect! I've successfully added Streamlit visualization to your data lineage POC. Here's what I've implemented:

  ✅ Streamlit Dashboard Features:

  1. Interactive Network Graph - Visual representation of data flows between datasets and jobs
  2. Pipeline Metrics - Success rates, run counts, and performance stats
  3. Column-Level Lineage - Detailed field-to-field transformation mappings
  4. Data Quality Insights - Row count changes and data reduction metrics
  5. Run History - Complete timeline of pipeline executions
  6. Raw Event Explorer - JSON event data browser

  🚀 How to Use:

  1. Install dependencies (already done):
  pip install streamlit networkx plotly

  2. Launch the dashboard:
  streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py

  3. Open in browser: The app will automatically open at http://localhost:8501

  📊 Dashboard Components:

  - Left Panel: Interactive network graph showing data flows
  - Right Panel: Real-time pipeline metrics and recent runs
  - Tabs:
    - Run History: Complete execution timeline
    - Column Lineage: Field-level transformation details
    - Data Quality: Row count analysis and reduction metrics
    - Raw Events: JSON event data exploration

  The Streamlit app automatically loads your existing lineage data from lineage/events/events.csv and provides a much more user-friendly way to explore your data
  lineage compared to the Mermaid diagrams. You can now easily visualize how your ETL pipelines transform data and track the relationships between your datasets!

> Track Data Flow: Build a Tool to Trace how
  Data Moves and Changes
  PROBLEM STATEMENT
  In many organizations, it’s difficult to trace how data flows through different systems – where it
  comes from, how it gets transformed, and where it ends up. Without this visibility, errors are hard to
  debug, reports can’t be trusted, and audits become time--consuming. This project aims to solve that
  problem by building a simple, program that helps teams track the movement and transformation of
  data across files or processes, making data workflows easier to understand, maintain and trust.

    - Database connector (Postgres, MySQL)
    - Cloud storage integration (S3, GCS)
    - BI tool integration (Tableau, PowerBI)

  🎯 Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order):

  1. High Impact, Low Effort: Add data quality metrics and schema tracking
  2. Medium Impact, Medium Effort: Build REST API and improve error handling
  3. High Impact, High Effort: Add real-time streaming and enterprise features

  Your current implementation is already production-ready for small to medium teams and demonstrates excellent understanding of data lineage principles. The
  foundation you've built makes these enhancements very achievable!

⏺ Requirements for Advanced Features:

  4. Real-time Streaming Support (Kafka)

  What you need:
  - No new accounts required
  - Install locally: pip install kafka-python
  - Run Kafka locally using Docker: docker run -p 9092:9092 apache/kafka:latest
  - OR use cloud services: Confluent Cloud (free tier), AWS MSK, or Azure Event Hubs

  5. Impact Analysis

  What you need:
  - Nothing new - just enhanced Python code using your existing data
  - Maybe pip install networkx (already installed)

  6. Data Catalog Integration

  What you need:
  - Apache Atlas: Docker setup locally OR cloud deployment
  - DataHub: Free GitHub account + Docker setup OR DataHub Cloud (free tier)
  - Alternative: Amundsen (Lyft's open source catalog)

  7. Authentication & Authorization

  What you need:
  - No external accounts
  - Add: pip install flask-jwt-extended python-jose cryptography
  - OR integrate with existing auth providers (Google, GitHub OAuth)

  8. Advanced Visualization

  What you need:
  - Nothing new - enhance existing Streamlit app
  - Maybe pip install plotly-dash for more advanced charts

  9. Alerting & Monitoring

  What you need:
  - Simple: Email alerts (no accounts needed, use SMTP)
  - Advanced: Slack webhooks (free Slack workspace) OR Discord webhooks
  - Enterprise: PagerDuty (free tier), Datadog (free tier)

  Bottom line: Most features can be implemented without new paid accounts. Kafka and DataHub have good local Docker setups for development.
